# 743. Network Delay Time

# There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
# Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
# Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

# Example 1:
# Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
# Output: 2

# Note:
# N will be in the range [1, 100].
# K will be in the range [1, N].
# The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
# All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.
