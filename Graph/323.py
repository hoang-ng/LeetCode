# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

# Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

# Example 1:
# Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

#      0          3
#      |          |
#      1 --- 2    4 
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

#      0           4
#      |           |
#      1 --- 2 --- 3
# Output:  1

# Note:
# You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
