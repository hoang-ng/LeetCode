# 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree

# Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.
# Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.
# If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.
